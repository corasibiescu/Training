According to the American Dietetic Association, “appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.” Although the research is mainly focused on vegetarian diet, it also has stated that a vegan diet could also provide health benefits and prevent diseases if it is properly planned and flowed. This supports the view of ‘The World Health Organisation’.
